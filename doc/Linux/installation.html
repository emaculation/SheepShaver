<h1>Installation</h1>
<p>You need at least a 2.2.x kernel, glibc 2.1 and GTK+ 1.2. Earlier versions will not work.</p>
<ol>
<li>Unpack the SheepShaver archive (if you are reading this, you probably have already done this)</li>
<li>Even when running on a PowerMac, you need a copy of a PCI PowerMac ROM (4MB) in a file called "ROM" in the same folder SheepShaver is in (but you can select a different location in the settings window). SheepShaver can also use the "Mac OS ROM" file that comes with MacOS 8.5/8.6 (look in the System Folder on your MacOS CD). In order to legally use SheepShaver, you have to own the ROM the image file was taken from.</li>
</ol>
