<h1>Introduction</h1>
<p>SheepShaver is a MacOS run-time environment for Linux that allows you to run MacOS applications at native speed inside the Linux multitasking environment on PowerPC-based Linux systems. This means that both Linux and MacOS applications can run at the same time and data can be exchanged between them.</p>
<p>SheepShaver is neither a MacOS replacement nor an emulator. It runs an unmodified PowerPC MacOS under control of Linux at full speed without any kind of emulation. So it also uses the MacOS 68k emulator to run 68k applications. In this way, SheepShaver is comparable to the "Blue Box" of Apple's Rhapsody operating system.</p>
<h2>Some of SheepShaver's features</h2>
<ul>
<li>Compatibility: SheepShaver runs MacOS 7.5.2 thru 8.6 with all system extensions like AppleGuide, AppleScript, QuickTime, QuickTime VR, QuickDraw 3D, Open Transport, PPP, Language Kits, ColorSync, etc.</li>

<li>Networking: SheepShaver supports Internet and LAN networking via Ethernet and PPP with all Open Transport compatible MacOS applications.</li>

<li>Data Exchange: You can access Linux files from the MacOS via a "Linux" icon on the Mac desktop and copy and paste text between Linux and MacOS.</li>
