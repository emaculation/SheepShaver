<h1>Troubleshooting</h1>
<h2>SheepShaver doesn't boot</h2>
<p>SheepShaver should boot all MacOS versions &gt;=7.5.2, except MacOS X. However, your mileage may vary. If it doesn't boot, try again with extensions disabled (by pressing the shift key) and then remove some of these extensions: "MacOS Licensing Extension", Speed Doubler, 68k FPU extensions and MacsBug.</p>
<h2>The colors are wrong in 16 or 32 bit graphics modes</h2>
<p>If you're running SheepShaver on a something other than a PowerMac, it may be that 16 or 32 bit graphics modes show false colors due to the frame buffer being little-endian. Apart from patching the X server, there's unfortunately nothing that you or SheepShaver can do about this.</p>
<h2>Full-screen mode doesn't work</h2>
<p>Some X servers on Linux PPC don't support DGA and full-screen mode cannot be used with these (in this case, you should disable it in the "Graphics" settings). If you are seeing a message like "cannot map /dev/kmem (permission denied)", you have to either run SheepShaver as root (not recommended) or give yourself appropriate access rights to /dev/kmem if you can login as root.</p>
<h2>Ethernet doesn't work</h2>
<ul>
<li>You have to either install the sheep_net driver or configure the ethertap device in the Linux kernel to use Ethernet. See <a href="using.html">Using SheepShaver</a> for more information.</li>
<li>If you're using TCP/IP on the MacOS side, you have to set up different IP addresses for Linux and for the MacOS.</li>
</ul>
<h2>SheepShaver crashes, but yesterday it worked</h2>
<p>Try the "Zap PRAM File" item in the main menu of the SheepShaver preferences editor. When you are using a ROM file and switching to a different ROM version, you <b>have</b> to zap the PRAM file or SheepShaver might behave very weird.</p>
<h2>Known incompatibilities</h2>
<ul>
<li>MacOS programs or drivers which access Mac hardware directly are not supported by SheepShaver.</li>
<li>Speed Doubler, RAM Doubler, 68k FPU emulators and similar programs don't run under SheepShaver.</li>
<li>MacsBug is not compatible with SheepShaver.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Known bugs</h2>
<ul>
<li>The QuickTime 2.5 Cinepak codec crashes the emulator.</li>
<li>Programs that use InputSprockets crash the emulator when in window mode.</li>
<li>The mouse cursor hotspot in window mode is not correct.</li>
</ul>
